# Ekho — A Tiny Hardware Voice-Memo Device
Ekho is a pocket-sized, hexagon-shaped voice-note device. Press a button, record a quick thought, and play it back anytime.
 The idea came from the Idea of me making ideas.It allows One-tap recording using an I2S microphone. And is small enoght to be carried around (58 mm hexagon enclosure).
