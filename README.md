# Ekho — A Tiny Hardware Voice-Memo Device
Ekho is a pocket-sized, hexagon-shaped voice-note device. Press a button, record a quick thought, and play it back anytime.
 The idea came from the Idea of me making ideas.It allows One-tap recording using an I2S microphone. And is small enoght to be carried around (58 mm hexagon enclosure). It basically alows me to store several short notes on it.
 I'm not really sur what else to add to this so here is my parts list 😛:

 Component            | Notes                  
 -------------------- | ---------------------- 
 Xiao ESP32-C3        | Brain of Ekho          
 I2S Microphone       | Voice input            
 Mini Speaker         | Voice output           
 3× Tactile Buttons   | Record / Play / Delete 
 1× LED + resistor    | Status indicator       
 JST-PH 2.0 connector | Battery input          
 LiPo battery         | Power                  
 Misc decoupling caps | Stability             


I hope that my later models will have a screen, and possibly smaller, but this is what can be achieved for now.
